Along with verifying the focal plane and radiation hardness of the 3-layer lens design, another crucial step towards solidifying the EIC DIRC design was to test the lens in a prototype DIRC with a real particle beam. Because not all of the components of the high-performance DIRC baseline design for EIC are currently available it is necessary to validate the simulation package currently used to design and optimize the system. In June and July of 2015 the PANDA Barrel DIRC group along with Lee Allison and Dr. Grzegorz Kalicy from ODU conducted a test beam at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) with a prototype DIRC for the PANDA experiment. This was used as an opportunity to evaluate the performance of the 3-layer lens in a real particle beam. The beam was a tunable hadron-rich beam with momentum from 1 - 10 GeV/c. The EIC DIRC simulation package was modified to use this new geometry setup so that data could be compared to simulation. The two most important quantities measured during this test beam were the photon yield per track and the single photon resolution (SPR). Verifying these measurements with simulation will give a good indication that the performance shown in Chapter \ref{ch:eicdirc} are what should be reasonably expected from a real EIC DIRC detector.

\section{2015 Test Beam Prototype Setup}
The PANDA prototype was situated in the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) T9 experimental hall \cite{CERN_T9}. A 200 mm thick aluminum target was used to produce a hadron-rich beam comprised mostly of protons, pions, muons, and electrons with a very small amount of kaons. A series of dipole and quadrupole magnets allowed for steering and focusing of the beam, as well as selecting specific particle momenta between 1 and 10 GeV/c for data taking. A scintillator monitored the intensity of the beam and a wire chamber monitored the x/y profile at the exit of the beam pipe.

\end{figure}

A CAD drawing of the experimental setup in the T9 hall can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:testbeam_2015}. The DIRC prototype was situated between two time-of-flight (TOF) detectors that were spaced 29 m apart to tag protons and pions. Figure \ref{fig:TOF_PID} shows the time-based separation of different particle species for 4 different beam momenta. Two scintillator counters (named Trigger 1 and Trigger 2) were placed in front of and behind the prototype. A coincidence of the trigger signals was used as the DAQ event recording trigger. Two veto counters were also set up between the two TOF detectors to reject background particles that strayed significantly from the beam path.

	\label{fig:PANDA_prototype}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:PANDA_prototype} shows a CAD drawing of the prototype setup. The prototype was held in place by a custom-built aluminum support structure with rails and a rotating table that allow the detector to be translated and rotated relative to the beam. The rotation of the prototype was verified using a remotely operated motor and camera. The radiator was carefully held in place by two aluminum braces equipped with three micrometer screws each which allowed for fine adjustments in the position of the bar. Alignment of all components in the beam line were done with a GLL2-80 Dual Plane Leveling and Alignment Laser by Bosch \cite{BoschLaser}, which provides both vertical and horizontal self-leveled planes. An example of alignment of a radiator plate is shown in Figure \ref{fig:testbeam_alignment}.

	\label{fig:prototype_prism}
\end{figure}

The optical component is attached to one end of the bar and a mirror is attached to the other. A compact prism expansion volume with dimensions $50\times170\times300\unit{mm}^3$ and an opening angle of $30^\circ$ (shown in Figure \ref{fig:prototype_prism}) was attached to the optical component (except in the case of an air-gap lens). A $3\times5$ array of PHOTONIS Planacon XP85102 MCP-PMTs with a total of 960 pixels were held in place by a support structure and coupled to the expansion volume. The MCP-PMTs were read out by a DAQ system based on the trigger and readout board (TRB3) and the PADIWA discriminator card \cite{PANDA_electronics}. Couplings between the bar/lens, lens/prism, and prism/MCP-PMTs were done using Eljen EJ-550 optical grease \cite{EljenTech}. The mirror was not coupled directly to the bar, but held in place flat against the bar in order to prevent slight variations in grease thickness from effecting the angle of reflection.

The discriminating threshold signals for each MCP-PMT was adjusted and the difference between the discriminator and trigger signals were recorded by the TRB system. Noise events such as photons from delta electrons in the radiator bar and dark noise from the detectors were cut out using this timing information. Some channels had a very large background count rate and were masked. Calibration of the timing resolution of each channel was done using a 405 nm Picosecond Injection Laser (PiLas) PiL040SM by Advanced Laser Diode Systems \cite{PiLas} and a 660 nm Picosecond Pulsed Diode Laser (PDL 800-D) by PicoQuant \cite{PicoQuant}. The laser pulses were connected to an opal glass diffuser to illuminate the entire MCP-PMT plane. Calibrations were performed both daily and whenever the geometrical configuration changed.

Data were taken for approximately 30 days, accumulating roughly 500 million triggers. Both bar and plate radiator geometries were tested with several optical components. Scans in polar angle between $20^\circ$ and $160^\circ$ were taken for many configurations. Scans in momentum up to 10 GeV/c were taken for select angles and geometries. As this was an opportunistic run for the EIC group, data taking was based on the needs of the PANDA DIRC group. They required separation power information for pion/kaon at 3.5 GeV/c, but since the T9 beam had a very small amount of kaons it was decided to instead study pion/proton separation at 7 GeV/c as the difference in Cherenkov angle for the two cases is roughly the same (8 mrad). The results presented below will be from data with a bar radiator, 3-layer spherical lens, 7 GeV/c hadron-rich beam, and polar angles from  $20^\circ$ - $150^\circ$.

\section{Prototype Simulation}
The simulation of the 2015 prototype was crucial for data analysis as it allowed for the generation of the LUTs for geometrical reconstruction, as well as a reference for the hit patterns of the real-time monitoring system. A standalone GEANT4 simulation package was used, similar to that used for the EIC DIRC simulation in Chapter \ref{ch:eicdirc}. Material properties for fused silica, NLaK33, the mirror, the optical grease, and the MCP-PMTs were included. The timing resolution of the simulation was based on findings of the laser calibration data and set to be 200 ps. For each configuration of the prototype the geometry for each element (e.g. relative positioning for the bar to the lens and prism) were adjusted to the values carefully measured while changing configurations.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\caption{Channel-by-channel map of the relative quantum efficiency (QE) of each 8x8 pixel MCP-PMT used in the simulation of the 2015 test beam prototype (top). Absolute QE values in the simulation are the product of the channel-by-channel values with the wavelength dependent QE of a Planacon XP85012 MCP-PMT (bottom).}
	\label{fig:quantum_efficiency}
\end{figure}

Also included in the simulation is the quantum efficiency (QE) of the MCP-PMTs. Each MCP-PMT was scanned for QE and gain uniformity with a 372 nm laser pulser at Erlangen University. The mappings of QE were normalized to MCP 10 and used as relative QE maps in the simulation (Figure \ref{fig:quantum_efficiency} top). To get the absolute QE for each pixel a scan was done of the QE as a function of photon wavelength (Figure \ref{fig:quantum_efficiency} bottom). The QE in the simulation was calculated by multiplying the relative QE of each pixel by the QE corresponding to the wavelength of the photon being detected by the pixel in the simulation.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{proton_track_example.pdf}
	\caption{a) shows a visualization of the GEANT4 simulation of a single 7 GeV/c proton (red) traveling through the 2015 prototype with a bar radiator at a polar angle of $125^{\circ}$, b) is the accumulated hit pattern of 10,000 identical protons from simulation, and c) is the accumulated hit pattern of 10,000 tagged proton tracks from test beam data at 7 GeV/c beam and $125^{\circ}$ polar angle.}
	\label{fig:proton_track_example}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:proton_track_example}a shows an example of one simulated proton track with 7 GeV/c momentum (red) at a polar angle of $125^{\circ}$ traversing a bar radiator with the 3-layer lens focusing, and producing Cherenkov photons (yellow). Figure \ref{fig:proton_track_example}b is the accumulated hit pattern on the MCP-PMTs of 10,000 identical protons with the same configuration as in (a). Figure \ref{fig:proton_track_example}c is the accumulated hit pattern of 10,000 tagged proton events in the test beam data with 7 GeV/c beam momentum, $125^{\circ}$ polar angle, and the bar radiator and 3-layer lens configuration. The simulation very nicely reproduces the test beam hit pattern, giving a good indication that the simulation has the proper positioning of all the components.

\section{Data Analysis}
\subsection{Event Selection}
The prototype data taken were stored in the list mode data format of the HADES DAQ system prototcol \cite{HADES_DAQ} and converted offline into the CERN ROOT data format \cite{ROOT} for analysis. The DAQ was started by a signal from Trigger 1, and events were required to have signals in Trigger 1, Trigger 2, and both TOF counters to ensure a well-defined beam spot and valid $\pi/p$ tagging from the TOF system. The veto counters were also required in event selection, but later found to be unnecessary for constraining the beam spot.

MCP-PMT signals, or hits, were selected in a time window of $\pm 40$ ns relative to the Trigger 1 time. Channels with large electronics noise above 1 MHz and one defective PADIWA card were masked, with the same masking scheme applied to the simulation. Events with 5 or fewer MCP-PMT hits were also excluded from reconstruction due to lack of statistics.

As mentioned previously the timing difference between the two TOF stations allowed for tagging an event as either pion or proton. Figure \ref{fig:tof_timing} shows the TOF time distributions for 5 GeV/c (top) and 7 GeV/c (bottom) beam momenta. These distributions were fitted with Gaussian functions near the proton and pion peaks and a $\pm2\sigma$ window around the peaks was used for selection (dashed lines).

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{TOF_timing.pdf}
	\caption{Time difference between the two TOF stations for beam momenta of 5 GeV/c (top) and 7 GeV/c (bottom). The peaks were fitted and a $\pm2\sigma$ selection window was taken (dashed lines).}
	\label{fig:tof_timing}
\end{figure}

The timing of the hits in the MCP-PMTs were also constrained. Based on the orientation of the detector in the beam the time for the photon to propagate can be calculated, giving an expected arrival time. Comparing the difference between this expected arrival time and the actual arrival time of the photons gives a time difference distribution. Figure \ref{fig:time_difference}

\subsection{Calibration and Corrections}

\subsubsection{Charge Sharing Correction for LUT Reconstruction}
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{charge_sharing.pdf}
	\caption{a) a zoom in on a single MCP showing an example hit pattern from a single particle track. The 3 isolated pixels (red) have no neighboring hits. The 3 clustered hits (green), however, are touching other firing pixels and thus it is hard to determine with timing alone if these are the result of a single photon from the bottom right pixel that resulted in charge sharing, 3 independent photons hitting all 3 pixels, or some combination of 2 photons hitting 2 of the pixels that resulted in charge sharing. To compensate for this uncertainty each pixel is subdivided, as in (b), into 9 regions such that the LUT will reconstruct the photon angle from different areas of the pixel. For the case of (a) the top pixel in the cluster would be reconstructed from point 7, the bottom left pixel from point 5, and the bottom right pixel from point 2, while the 3 isolated pixels would all be reconstructed from point 0.}
