  %This begins the list of reference or bibliography. The default form is consistent
  %with the references in the Physical Review. The articles must be listed in the order
  %in which they appear in the text. The style of the bibliography can be changed and
  %automatic ordering of the entries can be accomplished using BibTeX. Use of BibTeX is
  %explained in most of the standard LaTeX books.
