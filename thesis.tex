%Use this package and option to label equations, e.g. chapter 1 equation 2 is labeled as (1.2)

\usepackage{amsmath}

%Use this package to label figures and tables similarly to chapters above

\usepackage[figurewithin=chapter]{caption}

%This allows the use of scalable vector graphics (svg)
%Must use \includesvg{} 
%\usepackage{svg}

%This package causes the first line of a section to be indented as required by the dissertation guide.

%%%%%Other LaTeX2e packages such as the AMS fonts and graphics packages can be included here.

%This style follows conventions used in Physical Review C. The names of figures, tables and captions can
%be changed by using the commands below with appropriate changes. For example, "FIG." could be replaced by
%"Fig." or "Figure" to change the labeling of figure captions.

%\renewcommand{\figurename}{FIG.}
%\renewcommand{\tablename}{TABLE}
%\renewcommand{\bibname}{BIBLIOGRAPHY}

  %This begins the list of reference or bibliography.
  %The default form is consistent with the references in the Physical Review.
  %The articles must be listed in the order in which they appear in the text.
  %The style of the bibliography can be changed and automatic ordering of the entries can be accomplished using BibTeX.
  %Use of BibTeX is explained in most of the standard LaTeX books.
